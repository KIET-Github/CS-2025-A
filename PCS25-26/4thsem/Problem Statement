The identification and classification of historical monuments are crucial for heritage conservation, tourism, and academic research. However, manual identification is time-consuming and prone to human errors. This project aims to develop an AI-powered heritage identification system using deep learning to recognize and classify monuments based on images. By leveraging a trained neural network and a user-friendly interface via Streamlit, the system will assist researchers, conservationists, and travelers in accurately identifying heritage sites, thereby promoting cultural preservation and awareness.
